# A Wearable Compression-Based Assistive System for Managing POTS

**Author:** Atharv Dhore  
**Date:** February 6, 2026

## Overview
This repository documents an independent research project focused on the design of a wearable, compression-based assistive system for managing **Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)**. POTS is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that disrupts cardiovascular regulation during postural changes, often leading to tachycardia, dizziness, fatigue, and syncope.

Current treatment approaches rely on lifestyle modifications, medications, and static compression garments, which do not adapt to real-time physiological changes. This project proposes an adaptive, sensor-driven compression system that dynamically responds to postural transitions and circulatory needs.

## Research Summary
The proposed system consists of modular compression braces for the lower and upper limbs equipped with embedded sensors to monitor blood flow and pressure dynamics. Using a rule-based or AI-assisted control algorithm, the system adjusts compression levels in real time to counteract venous blood pooling during standing or prolonged upright posture.

Unlike traditional compression garments, this approach emphasizes personalization and adaptability. Over time, the system can identify individual physiological patterns, allowing compression intensity to be gradually adjusted as tolerance or autonomic function improves.

## Significance and Future Work
This research demonstrates how wearable sensing and intelligent control can be combined to create non-invasive, scalable solutions for autonomic disorders. While the primary focus is POTS, the same framework may be applicable to orthostatic hypotension, chronic venous insufficiency, and related conditions.

Future work includes prototype development, sensor validation, algorithm refinement, and eventual clinical studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness.
